This one-minute teaser is created for the exhibition project "ShangRabbit Runs to the Moon: An Experiment of AI Intervening in Traditional Culture" at the Art Museum of Nanjing University of the Arts (AMNUA).

The hand-drawn elements are turned into animation using Adobe After Effects (AE). As the rabbit runs, symbols, myths, legends, artefacts, and decorative patterns from the Late Neolithic period to the Wei-Jin era visually and narratively transform and intertwine, creating a dynamic fusion of history and imagination.

This trailer combines animation and interviews to introduce the exhibition’s conceptual origins, creative process, and final installation presentation. Additionally, this video, which I shot and edited, introduces how Midjourney can be used to reimagine creative possibilities.

## Chernobyl: Application of AIGC Technology in Short Film Production

<iframe width="400" height="225"

<br>

This is a short film entirely generated by AI. Chernobyl has become a forbidden zone, forgotten by history. Using AI technology, we imagined the scenes before and after the nuclear disaster, focusing on the lives of ordinary people. In the absence of the ability to film, artificial intelligence allows us to revisit and understand this tragic chapter of history.

In this short film, we utilized generative language models, MidJourney, Runaway, along with editing software such as Premiere Pro (PR) and After Effects (AE).

Cyberlantern 2054, part of the Telling China’s Stories series, is presented in three episodes. In the story, Grandma, a lantern maker in 2054, relies on memory chips to make complicated lanterns. However, when an accident causes her to lose the chip and the guidance of the program, she must rely on her creativity—ultimately creating a lantern infused with deeper humanity.

As the director of this short film, I aim to explore the relationship between machine-generated creation, creativity, and ethics. In the future of rapid technological advancement, will some jobs be replaced by AI or programs? What we want to express is that human imagination remains irreplaceable, and creativity is a unique and invaluable asset.

Immortal Cosplay Talk Show part of the Telling China’s Stories project. In this short film, actors portray four Chinese Taoist immortals— the Kitchen God, Meng Po, Yue Lao, and the Four Great Heavenly Kings. Through their voices, the film blends folklore with modern social issues (e.g., pre-packaged meals, money worship). These immortals are not just legends but also spiritual symbols of traditional Chinese culture.

These teasers combine aerial shots and on-site filming to provide an immersive experience, allowing viewers to explore the true appearance of the Yangshan Stele. The sheer size of the stele has made its transportation a mystery, and now it stands alone atop Yangshan Mountain in Nanjing, waiting for future generations to offer new hypotheses.

In the Meta Stone project, I served as the video executive. During the early stages, I conducted on-site filming and edited multiple teasers to introduce the audience to the real appearance of the Yangshan Stele. These teasers also set the stage for the forum’s central discussion: What was the purpose of the stone stele, and how was it transported to Yangshan? During the creative forum, I was responsible for live filming, capturing valuable video records of the discussions and speculations.

The story revolves around the relationship between a grandmother and her granddaughter, with the granddaughter’s attempts to stop her grandma’s shopping habits adding comedic elements. Ultimately, the film aims to convey that love cannot be measured by money. For every “bargain-loving” grandma, we should offer more time and companionship.
