# About Me

<img src="https://mujinglin.github.io/images/mujing.jpg" class="floatpic">

I am Lin Mujing (林沐菁), currently pursuing an MA in Arts and Machine Creativity at HKUST. I graduated from Nanjing University of the Arts in Broadcasting and Television Directing (2025).

My research interests focus on AI-assisted artistic creation, particularly short films, and AI-driven automation in video editing workflows. I am passionate about exploring how generative and automated tools can enhance storytelling efficiency and expand creative possibilities in filmmaking.

Previously, I directed and produced promotional films, led student media initiatives, and worked as an executive director for variety shows, gaining hands-on experience in planning, production, and audience engagement. More recently, I have been experimenting with AI in visual projects, combining narrative, aesthetics, and technology to push the boundaries of creative media.

I am eager to keep building projects at the intersection of art, storytelling, and intelligent systems.
